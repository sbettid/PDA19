# Recommender Systems Competition - Master Computational Data Science 1st year

This repository contains the Python code I used to complete the Recommender Systems competition, 
valid as project for the "Programming for Data Analytics" class of the Master in Computational Data Science 2019. 

The code has been commented using Markdown annotations in the Jupyter Notebooks available in this repository 
and a general explanation of the process, involved algorithms and encountered problematics is available in the [Report.pdf](Report.pdf) file
